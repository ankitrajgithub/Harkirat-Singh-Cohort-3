Redux Toolkit (RTK) is the official, recommended, and "batteries-included" library for efficient Redux development. It 
is designed to address common concerns with vanilla Redux, such as complicated store configuration, excessive boilerplate 
code, and the need for extra packages to perform common tasks. 

Key Features and Benefits:
-Reduced Boilerplate: Tools like createSlice allow developers to define actions and reducers in one place, significantly 
reducing repetitive code.
-Simplified Setup: configureStore streamlines store setup with good default settings and built-in support for Redux 
DevTools.
-Built-in Async Logic: createAsyncThunk simplifies handling asynchronous API calls.
-Immutable Updates: Uses Immer internally, allowing developers to write "mutating" logic that is actually immutable.
-RTK Query: A powerful, built-in data fetching and caching tool designed to eliminate hand-written data fetching logic. 

Core Components:
-configureStore(): Sets up a Redux store with appropriate defaults.
-createSlice(): Generates action creators and reducer functions for a feature.
-createAsyncThunk(): Handles asynchronous data fetching.
-createEntityAdapter(): Generates reusable reducers for managing normalized state. 

Redux Toolkit vs. Vanilla Redux:
-Boilerplate: RTK eliminates the need for manual action types, action creators, and repetitive reducer logic.
-Configuration: RTK requires much less configuration than vanilla Redux.
-Maintainability: RTK enforces best practices, resulting in cleaner and more maintainable code. 
When to Use Redux Toolkit
-Redux Toolkit is recommended for all Redux-based applications, whether starting a new project or migrating an existing 
one. It is particularly beneficial for managing complex state in large applications.
