Children - The children prop allows you to pass elements or components as props to other components.

Lists & Keys - When rendering lists, each item should have a unique key prop for React to track 
changes efficiently.

Inline Styling - Inline styling in React allows you to apply CSS styles directly to elements using 
a JavaScript object.
function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <div style={{ backgroundColor: 'blue', color: 'white' }}>
      Hello, World!
    </div>
  );
}

Class-Based Component - Class components are  classes that extend React.Component, while functional 
components are simpler and can use Hooks.
A class-based component in React is a JavaScript ES6 class that extends React.Component and includes a render() 
method to return HTML (JSX). They were historically used for managing state and accessing lifecycle methods, but 
modern React development now favors functional components with Hooks.

Functional Component - Functional components in React are JavaScript functions that accept props as input and 
return JSX to render UI, serving as the modern standard for building components. They are lightweight, concise, 
and easy to test, typically using hooks like useState and useEffect to manage state and lifecycle events.

Lifecycle Events - In React, lifecycle events (or lifecycle methods) refer to the specific points in a component's 
life where you can execute code in response to changes or actions. These events help you manage tasks such as data 
fetching, subscriptions, and cleaning up resources.

Class-Based Lifecycle Methods - In class components, lifecycle methods are divided into three main phases:
1. Mounting: When the component is being inserted into the DOM.
    - constructor(): Called when the component is initialized.
    - componentDidMount(): Called immediately after the component is mounted. Ideal for data fetching.
2. Updating: When the component is being re-rendered due to changes in props or state.
    - componentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState): Called after the component has updated. Good for operations based 
       on prop/state changes.
3. Unmounting: When the component is being removed from the DOM.
    - componentWillUnmount(): Ideal for cleanup tasks, like invalidating timers or canceling network requests.

Error Boundary - Error boundaries are React components that catch JavaScript errors in their child component 
tree and display a fallback UI.
Error boundaries only exist in class based components.

Fragment - In React, a component can return a single parent element, but it can contain multiple children 
within that single parent.
Wrong Code-
const MyComponent = () => {
    return (
        <h1>Hello</h1>
        <p>World</p> // This line will cause an error
    );
};
Right Code-
const MyComponent = () => {
    return (
        <>
            <h1>Hello</h1>
            <p>World</p>
        </>
    );
};
