Basics: Typography

Typeface is the design of the letters (e.g., Rethink Sans, Poppins). **Font** refers to a specific style 
or weight within that typeface (e.g., Poppins Bold 16px). 
In simple terms, typeface is the family, and font is the individual member within the family.

Types of Fonts:
1. Serif Fonts:
- Serif fonts have small lines attached to the end of strokes in letters. These fonts are seen as formal, 
traditional, and trustworthy.
- **Examples**: Times New Roman, Georgia, Merriweather.
- **Use Case**: Print media, high-end brands, blogs, and news websites for body text. Gives a classic, 
professional feel.

2. Sans-Serif Fonts:
- Sans-serif fonts are clean, modern, and lack the “feet” at the end of strokes.
- **Examples**: Helvetica, Arial, Roboto, Open Sans.
- **Use Case**: Digital screens, UI interfaces, tech websites, and modern brands. Best for readability on 
screens.

3. Script Fonts:
- Mimic handwriting or calligraphy and are decorative in nature.
- **Examples**: Brush Script, Lobster, Pacifico.
- **Use Case**: Should be used sparingly for logos or headings. Avoid for body text as they are hard to read in long form.

4. Display Fonts: 
- Highly decorative fonts meant for limited use, often in large sizes.
- **Examples**: Impact, Bebas Neue, Playfair Display.
- **Use Case**: Headlines, posters, banners, and branding materials where you want to grab attention.

5. Monospace Fonts:
- Every letter takes up the same amount of horizontal space.
- **Examples**: Courier, Consolas, Source Code Pro.
- **Use Case**: Code snippets, terminal interfaces, or designs where a techy or vintage aesthetic is needed.

Font Weight - Font weight refers to the thickness of each character in of the font.
> Tip: Avoid overusing bold or italic, as too much emphasis can reduce clarity and hierarchy.

Font Size:
- Hierarchy can be introduces through size. Typography hierarchy is the arrangement of text to show its importance.
- **Headings (H1, H2, H3)**: Larger font sizes for headings, usually starting with 32-48px for H1 and scaling down.
- **Body Text**: 16px is the standard size for comfortable readability on most screens. For mobile, 14-16px works best.
> **Best Practice:** Maintain proportional sizes between headings and body text to create a visual flow.

Typography Jargon:
- Leading (Line height): The space between lines of text. Too tight makes it hard to read, too loose makes the text 
disjointed. For body text, a line-height of 1.5 to 1.75 times the font size is typically ideal.
- Tracking (letter spacing): The space between characters in a block of text, affecting the overall density of text. 
It’s better not to change this unless you know what you’re doing as it might create a bad reading experience.
- Kerning: The space between specific pairs of letters to make the text look more balanced (e.g., A and V in some fonts).
