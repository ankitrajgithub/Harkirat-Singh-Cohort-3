Components - In React, components are the building blocks of the user interface. They allow you to split the UI 
into independent, reusable pieces that can be thought of as custom, self-contained HTML elements.

props - Props are the way to pass data from one component to another in React.

useState - useState is a Hook that lets you add state to functional components. It returns an array with the 
current state and a function to update it.

useEffect :-
Side Effects - Side effects are operations that interact with the outside world or have effects beyond the 
component's rendering. Examples include:
- Fetching data from an API.
- Modifying the DOM manually.
- Subscribing to events (like WebSocket connections, timers, or browser events).
- Starting a clock
These are called side effects because they don't just compute output based on the input—they affect things 
outside the component itself.

Problem in running side effects in React components
If you try to introduce side effects directly in the rendering logic of a component (in the return statement 
or before it), React would run that code every time the component renders. This can lead to:
- **Unnecessary or duplicated effects** (like multiple API calls).
- **Inconsistent behavior** (side effects might happen before rendering finishes).
- **Performance issues** (side effects could block rendering or cause excessive re-rendering).

How `useEffect` Manages Side Effects:
The `useEffect` hook lets you perform side effects in functional components in a safe, predictable way:

useEffect(() => {
  // Code here is the "effect" — this is where side effects happen
  fetchData();

  // Optionally, return a cleanup function that runs when the component unmounts.
  return () => {
    // Cleanup code, e.g., unsubscribing from an event or clearing timers.
  };
}, [/* dependencies */]);

- **The first argument** to `useEffect` is the effect function, where you put the code that performs the side effect.
- **The second argument** is the dependencies array, which controls when the effect runs. This array tells React to 
re-run the effect only when certain values (props or state) change. If you pass an empty array `[]`, the effect will only 
run **once** after the initial render.
- **Optional Cleanup**: If your side effect needs cleanup (e.g., unsubscribing from a WebSocket, clearing intervals), 
`useEffect` allows you to return a function that React will call when the component unmounts or before re-running the effect.
