Pick
Pick allows you to create a new type by selecting a set of properties (Keys) from an existing type (Type).
Imagine you have a User model with several properties, but for a user profile display, you only need a subset 
of these properties.

Partial
Partial makes all properties of a type optional, creating a type with the same properties, but each marked 
as optional.
 
Readonly
When you have a configuration object that should not be altered after initialization, making it Readonly 
ensures its properties cannot be changed.

Record
Record let’s you give a cleaner type to objects

Map
maps gives you an even fancier way to deal with objects. Very similar to Maps in C++

Exclude
In a function that can accept several types of inputs but you want to exclude specific types from being 
passed to it.
