Redux is a state management library that uses a unidirectional data flow architecture centered around a 
single store, with updates triggered by actions and processed by pure reducer functions. The react-redux 
library provides the Provider component to make the store accessible to all React components. 

Here is a breakdown of the core concepts:

-State: The state is the immutable data tree (typically a plain JavaScript object) that describes the condition 
of the application at a specific point in time. The UI is a rendering of the current state. 
-Action: An action is a plain JavaScript object that describes what happened in the application (e.g., a 
user clicked a "Buy" button). It must have a type field (usually a string like 'todos/todoAdded') and can 
contain other data in a payload field.
-Reducer: Reducers are pure functions that take the current state and an action as arguments and return a 
new state. They specify how the state changes in response to an action, following an immutability principle 
(they must not modify the original state directly).
-Store: The store is the single source of truth that holds the entire global state of the application. 
It is a JavaScript object with methods like getState(), dispatch(action), and subscribe(listener).
-Provider: The Provider is a React component from the react-redux library that makes the Redux store available 
to all components nested within it via the React context mechanism. You wrap your root application component 
with the Provider, passing the store as a prop.

The Redux Data Flow:
-UI Interaction: Something happens in the UI (e.g., a user clicks a button).
-Dispatch Action: The application code calls store.dispatch(action) to announce that an event occurred.
-Reducer Execution: The store runs the root reducer function, passing the current state and the dispatched action. 
The reducer calculates and returns the new state immutably.
-Store Update: The store saves the new state.
-UI Re-render: The store notifies all subscribed UI components that the state has been updated, triggering them 
to re-render with the new data.
