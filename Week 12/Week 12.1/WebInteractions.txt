# Web Interactions (Pt 2)

**Web interactions** are behaviors and responses that occur when users engage with a website or app. These interactions guide users, encourage engagement, and can add an element of fun to the experience.

**Key Types of Web Interactions:**

1. **Hover Effects**
    - **Purpose**: Provide visual feedback when a user hovers over elements like buttons, images, or links.
    - **Example**: Changing the color, expanding an element, or showing additional options when hovering.
    - **Best Practice**: Keep hover effects subtle but noticeable; excessive animation can overwhelm or distract the user.
2.  **Scroll-Based Interactions**
    - **Purpose**: Animate elements based on the user’s scroll position, creating a dynamic narrative as they move down the page.
    - **Example**: Parallax effects, fade-ins, or moving elements that follow the user’s scroll.
    - **Best Practice**: Avoid overly complex effects that can cause performance issues or interfere with accessibility. Ensure animations are smooth and do not block content.
3.  **Loading Animations**
    - **Purpose**: Provide visual feedback when loading content, improving perceived loading times.
    - **Example**: Spinners, progress bars, skeleton screens (placeholders mimicking the layout of actual content).
    - **Best Practice**: Make loading animations brief and relevant, giving users a sense of how long they need to wait.
4. **Gestural Interactions (For Mobile)**
    - **Purpose**: Allow users to swipe, pinch, and tap to interact with the app or site.
    - **Example**: Swiping left or right to switch tabs, pinching to zoom in/out on images.
    - **Best Practice**: Make gestures intuitive; they should align with common mobile gestures for usability.

**Common Types of Tactile Feedback:**

1. **Visual Feedback**
2. **Auditory Feedback**
3.  **Haptic Feedback (for Mobile)**
