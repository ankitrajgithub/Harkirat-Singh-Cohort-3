React - React is just an easier way to write normal HTML/CSS/JS
It’s a new syntax, that under the hood gets converted to HTML/CSS/JS

Some react jargon - To create a react app, you usually need to worry about two things:-
1. State - An object that represents the current state of the app. State is data owned by a component
that can change over time and affects what is rendered on the screen.
It represents the dynamic things in your app (things that change).
When state changes, React re-renders the component.
For example, the value of the counter.
2. Component - How a DOM element should render, given a state.
It is a re-usable, dynamic, HTML snippet that changes given the state.
A component is a reusable, independent piece of the UI.
Think of components like functions that return UI.

A button is a component. It takes the state (currentCount) as an input and is supposed to
render accordingly.

A state change triggers a re-render. A re-render represents the actual DOM being manipulated 
when the state changes.

You usually have to deﬁne all your components once and then all you have to do is update the 
state of your app, React takes care of re-rendering your app.
