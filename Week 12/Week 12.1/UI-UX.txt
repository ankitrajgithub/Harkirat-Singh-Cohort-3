Introduction to UI/UX:

User Interface (UI) - Includes visual elements such as buttons, text, images, entry fields and anything the user can/could 
interact with.

User Experience (UX) - Includes how a user interacts with and experiences a product.

## Difference between User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX)?
UX without UI is like brain without a body & a UI without UX is like a human without it’s brain.
