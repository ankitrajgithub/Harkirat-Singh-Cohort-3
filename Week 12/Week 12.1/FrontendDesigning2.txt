# UI/Frontend Development (Pt 2)

At high level frontend dev is a bridge between design and functionality, transforming static designs into interactive, 
responsive experience that look and work well on all devices.

Key Points:

1. Translating Mockups into Code
2. Accessibility First
3. Performance Optimization
4. Making it Responsive

1.  Translating Mockups into Code
    - Get measurements, color codes, and font styles directly from designs for pixel-perfect UI.
    - Implement a mobile-first or desktop-first approach based on your target audience—whichever device is likely to have 
    the larger user base.
    - Best Practices:
        - **Semantic HTML**: Use elements that define the structure (e.g., <header>, <footer>, <main>) to make the content 
        easy to understand for both users and search engines.
        - **Keep it Clean and Simple**: Avoid unnecessary <div> wrappers. Aim for a minimal and logical structure.
        - **Please use CSS Flexbox and CSS Grid**
            - Use **Flexbox** for simple, one-dimensional layouts like navigation bars.
            - Use **CSS Grid** for complex two-dimensional layouts, allowing you to position elements with rows and columns.
                                
    
2. Focus on Accessibility
    - Ensure keyboard navigation works for all interactive elements.
    - Add alt attributes for images, proper labels for form elements, and ensure good **color contrast** for readability.
    - Use semantic HTML tags (e.g., <button>, <header>, <nav>) to help screen readers and improve the overall accessibility 
    of the site.
    
3. Performance Optimization
    - Minimize the number of HTTP requests by combining files or using sprites.
    - Optimize images (compress them) and use **lazy loading** for media-heavy content.
    - Use minified CSS and JavaScript files in production.
