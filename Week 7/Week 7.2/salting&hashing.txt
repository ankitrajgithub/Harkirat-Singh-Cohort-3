## salt

A popular approach to hashing passwords involves using a hashing algorithm 
that incorporates a salt—a random value added to the password before hashing.
This prevents attackers from using precomputed tables (rainbow tables) to 
crack passwords.

## bcrypt

**Bcrypt**: It is a cryptographic hashing algorithm designed for securely
hashing passwords. Developed by Niels Provos and David Mazières in 1999, 
bcrypt incorporates a salt and is designed to be computationally expensive, 
making brute-force attacks more difficult.
