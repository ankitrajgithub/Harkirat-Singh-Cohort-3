Single page applications, routing - Single Page Applications (SPAs) are web applications that load a single 
HTML page and dynamically update that page as the user interacts with the app. This approach allows for a 
smoother user experience compared to traditional multi-page applications (MPAs), where each interaction often 
requires a full page reload.

Layouts - Layouts let you wrap every route inside a certain component (think headers and footers).

useRef - In React, useRef is a hook that provides a way to create a reference to a value or a DOM element that 
persists across renders but does not trigger a re-render when the value changes.

Key Characteristics of useRef:
1. Persistent Across Renders: The value stored in `useRef` persists between component re-renders. This 
means the value of a `ref` does not get reset when the component re-renders, unlike regular variables.
2. No Re-Renders on Change: Changing the value of a `ref` (`ref.current`) does **not** cause a component 
to re-render. This is different from state (`useState`), which triggers a re-render when updated.
