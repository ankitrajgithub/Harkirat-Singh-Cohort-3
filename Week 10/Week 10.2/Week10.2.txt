Rolling up the state, unoptimal re-renders - As your application grows, you might find that multiple components need 
access to the same state. Instead of duplicating state in each component, you can lift the state up to the LCA, allowing 
the common ancestor to manage it.

Prop drilling - **Prop drilling** occurs when you need to pass data from a higher-level component down to a lower-level 
component that is several layers deep in the component tree. This often leads to the following issues:
-Complexity: You may have to pass props through many intermediate components that don’t use the props themselves, 
just to get them to the component that needs them.
-Maintenance: It can make the code harder to maintain, as changes in the props structure require updates in multiple 
components.

The Context API is a powerful feature in React that enables you to manage state across your application more effectively, 
especially when dealing with deeply nested components.
The Context API provides a way to share values (state, functions, etc.) between components without having to pass props 
down manually at every level. 
Jargon:
- Context: This is created using `React.createContext()`. It serves as a container for the data you want to share.
- Provider: This component wraps part of your application and provides the context value to all its descendants. Any 
component that is a child of this Provider can access the context.
- Consumer: This component subscribes to context changes. It allows you to access the context value (using `useContext`  
hook)

Introducing recoil - To minimise the number of re-renders, and ensure that only components that are `subscribed` to a value 
`render, state management was introduced.

There are many libraries that let you do state management - 

1. mobx
2. recoil
3. redux

Here is a simple example with `recoil`
- npm install recoil
